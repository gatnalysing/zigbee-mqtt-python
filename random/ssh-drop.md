SSH sessions can become unresponsive or "hang" for various reasons. Here are some common ones:

1. **Network Instability**: If there are intermittent issues with your network connection, the SSH session can disconnect or hang. This is particularly common with Wi-Fi connections or when connecting over unstable internet connections.

2. **Server Load**: If the server you're connecting to experiences high resource usage (CPU, RAM, etc.), it might become slow to respond or unresponsive.

3. **SSH Client/Server Timeouts**: Both the SSH client and server have timeout settings. If there's no activity in a session for a specific duration, the connection might be dropped. On the server side, this is controlled by the `ClientAliveInterval` and `ClientAliveCountMax` settings in the `sshd_config` file. On the client side, the `ServerAliveInterval` setting in the SSH client configuration can be used to send null packets to the server, preventing timeouts.

4. **Firewall or Security Software**: Some security software or firewalls might terminate connections that have been idle for a while.

5. **Terminal Session States**: If the terminal is waiting for input (like if a command is running that's waiting for user input), it may seem like it's hung, especially if the prompt isn't clear.

6. **Hardware Issues**: Rarely, hardware issues on the server, like a failing hard drive, can cause delays or hangs.

7. **TCP Keep-Alive**: The underlying TCP connection can get terminated or be in a broken state due to various reasons (like network changes, intermediary devices like routers or firewalls dropping the connection). SSH relies on TCP, so if the TCP connection breaks, the SSH session can hang.

8. **Terminal Multiplexers**: If you're using a terminal multiplexer like `tmux` or `screen`, and the multiplexer crashes or has issues, it might appear as if the SSH session is unresponsive.

### Solutions and Recommendations:

1. **Use a Terminal Multiplexer**: Tools like `tmux` or `screen` can be invaluable. Even if your SSH connection drops, the sessions inside these tools remain active. You can reconnect to SSH and re-attach to the session.

2. **Adjust Timeouts**: If you regularly experience timeouts, you can adjust the `ServerAliveInterval` setting on your SSH client to send keep-alive packets more frequently.

   In your `~/.ssh/config` (create it if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   Host *
   ServerAliveInterval 60
   ```
   This sends a keep-alive packet every 60 seconds to keep the connection active.

3. **Check Server Health**: If the server becomes unresponsive frequently, check its CPU load, memory usage, disk activity, and any running processes. Tools like `htop`, `vmstat`, and `iostat` can be helpful.

4. **Network Tools**: Use tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `mtr` to check for network stability between your client and the server.

5. **Reboot**: Sometimes, the simplest solution can be to restart the SSH service on the server (`sudo service ssh restart`) or to reboot the server if possible.

6. **Logs**: Check SSH logs on the server (commonly in `/var/log/auth.log` or `/var/log/secure`) for any clues regarding the disconnects.

Remember, diagnosing such issues can sometimes require a combination of checking logs, server health, network diagnostics, and configuration reviews. It can be a process of elimination to figure out the exact cause.
