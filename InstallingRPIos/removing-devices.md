In order to address the issue of Zigbee2MQTT repopulating deleted devices:

1. **Stop Zigbee2MQTT Service**:
   First, ensure that Zigbee2MQTT is not running.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop zigbee2mqtt
   ```

2. **Locate and Clear the Cache File**:
   Zigbee2MQTT typically stores its cache in a file called `database.db` in the same directory as your `configuration.yaml` file.
   
   To clear this file, you can simply remove it or rename it:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/database.db
   ```
   Or, to rename (which keeps a backup):
   ```bash
   sudo mv /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/database.db /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/database.db.backup
   ```

3. **Ensure Configuration File is Set Correctly**:
   Double-check that your `configuration.yaml` file is set as you intended, with `devices: {}` and `permit_join: false`.
   ```yaml
   homeassistant: false
   permit_join: false
   mqtt:
     base_topic: zigbee2mqtt
     server: mqtt://localhost
   serial:
     port: /dev/ttyACM0
   devices: {}
   ```

4. **Restart Zigbee2MQTT**:
   After making these changes, restart Zigbee2MQTT.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start zigbee2mqtt
   ```

5. **Monitor the Behavior**:
   - Check your `configuration.yaml` file after restarting to see if devices are still being automatically added. 
   - You can also monitor the logs using:
     ```bash
     sudo journalctl -u zigbee2mqtt -f
     ```

6. **Further Steps If Issue Persists**:
   - If the problem continues, it might be due to how Zigbee2MQTT interfaces with your Zigbee coordinator. In some cases, the coordinator might retain device information even after clearing Zigbee2MQTT's cache.
   - Updating Zigbee2MQTT to the latest version or resetting your Zigbee coordinator hardware might be necessary.
