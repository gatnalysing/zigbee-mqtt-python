This project is Reykjavík's step towards integrating smart technology into our urban fabric. We're starting with ZigBee-enabled street lamps, aiming to explore and learn from this pilot for broader smart city initiatives.

## The Plan

We're using Flask to create APIs for ZigBee gateway communication and Django for our management interface. The project also features an interactive map at reykjavik.gatnalysing.is, built with Leaflet and JavaScript for real-time monitoring and control.

Our next major goal is transitioning from deconz to Zigbee2mqtt. This shift is part of our commitment to open-source solutions and community-driven development. Alongside, we're considering Python-based tools like Prometheus for efficient logging and monitoring.

While ZigBee won't be city-wide, the insights we gain here are crucial. They'll guide us in scaling up smart technology solutions in Reykjavík, balancing innovation with practicality.

## Stay Tuned

Right now, we're deep into hardware setup and learning the ropes. Our focus is on getting the groundwork right, so our community engagement is still gearing up. Keep tracking our progress here, and as we get more adept with Git, we'll open up better channels for collaboration and input.
